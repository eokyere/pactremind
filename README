Project PACT to improve adherence to malaria medecine through text messages to 
patients enrolled. 

pactremind is an automated SMS-based reminder system, to help determine 
whether -and which- text message reminders can increase the completion of ACTs 
for treatment of presumptive malaria.

The core functionality of the system allows participants to be enrolled/removed 
from the study, randomly assigns participants to receive reminders (via SMS,) 
and sends reminders to participants based on a schedule. The system also allows 
reports to be created for text messages in CSV format. 

The system has been developed using the Python programming language.
